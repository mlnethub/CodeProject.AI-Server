         this special modulesettings.docker.build.json file that enables us to point the Python
         interpreter to the shared, pre-installed python venv in the Docker image. This file will be
         renamed to modulesettings.docker.json during the Docker image build process.

         If this module were downloaded and installed during runtime, then the usual
         modulesettings.linux.json would be loaded, followed by the modulesettings.docker.json file.
         The modulesettings.docker.build.json file would be ignored. Downloaded modules would have
         their Python interpreter point to a Local install of Python, not the shared, so that Python
         packages can be installed and persisted.
