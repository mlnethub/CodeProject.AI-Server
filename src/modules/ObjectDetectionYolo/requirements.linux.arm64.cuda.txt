PyYAML          # Installing PyYAML, a library for reading configuration files

# Specific versions that match the models we're using. This requires <= Python 3.9. Any
# version higher can use Python 3.10
# Torch==1.10.2        # Installing Torch, for Tensor computation and Deep neural networks
# TorchVision==0.11.3  # Installing TorchVision, for Computer Vision based AI

# ..except we need to be even more specific: 
# https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/failed-to-load-image-python-extension-could-not-find-module/140278/15
# torch==1.10.0
# torchvision==0.10.0

# the Ultralytics Yolov5 package
yolov5==6.2.3	# Installing Ultralytics YoloV5 package for object detection in images

# We won't install Torch here at all. It will be done via wheel install in the setup script
