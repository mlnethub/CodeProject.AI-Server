## NOTE: We don't really care about numpy here, BUT the bgrem module is a little picky. So we can
##       stick to the lower version of numpy instead of the 1.22.3 that currently gets installed.
##       However: this may not be needed if we're using pip -r requirements: it may figure out the
##       issues for us.
